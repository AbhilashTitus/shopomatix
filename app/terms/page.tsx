                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  We accept payments exclusively through UPI (Unified Payments Interface). All transactions are processed via NPCI-authorized UPI applications and compliant payment service providers that adhere to RBI regulations and applicable PCI DSS security standards. By initiating a payment, you agree to use a valid UPI ID or UPI-linked bank account that belongs to you and to provide accurate and complete payment information during checkout.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-dark mb-3 mt-6">5.2 Payment Flow and Processing</h3>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  Shopomatix operates as a marketplace intermediary. The payment flow works as follows:
                </p>
                <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4 space-y-2 ml-4">
                  <li>Customer places an order and makes payment through our authorized payment gateway</li>

                  <li>Order is confirmed and forwarded to the respective seller/merchant</li>
                  <li>Seller fulfills the order and delivers the product to the customer</li>
                  <li>After successful delivery confirmation and expiry of return period, payment is settled to the seller</li>
                  <li>Settlement typically occurs within 7-10 business days post-delivery</li>
                </ul>
                <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                  <strong>Important:</strong> Shopomatix acts as a facilitator and does not directly sell products. We channel payments between buyers and sellers through secure, RBI-compliant mechanisms.
